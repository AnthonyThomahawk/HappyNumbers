# HappyNumbers
A simple program written in C++ to find happy numbers :)

# Compiling & Usage
You can use any C++ compiler you want to compile this, although g++ and MSVC (from visual studio 2019) have been tested and working.

example of compiling and running with g++ (terminal commands) : <br />
_g++ happynumbers.cpp -o happynumbers <br />
./happynumbers_  <br />

After executing the program, via a menu you can either choose to check a single number for happiness, or search for all happy numbers up to a limit.

have fun
